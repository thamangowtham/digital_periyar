## Field Report

The Field Report module creates a report page that lists all of
the fields on the site, along with their label, description,
field type, and what they are shared with, organized by entity
type and bundle.

This should make it really easy to see how the fields are organized
onto your site, and identify any that are missing descriptions or
relevant labels, and find fields that could be shared but aren't, etc.
